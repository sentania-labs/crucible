"""Run Hermes, capture plain output, and enrich its usage record from per-run state.

FDY-0140:
- The task's IDENTITY.md is put in the prompt itself, ahead of the pointer, so the model
  starts from the instructions rather than having to decide to read them.
- Hermes 0.19's `-z` builds its agent with a fixed 90-turn budget and reads no turn
  setting. The limit Crucible passes is applied by running Hermes's own entry point
  under a small bootstrap that sets that budget when the agent is built. The context
  window is Hermes's own `model.context_length` setting, written to its home.
- Nothing is added to PATH. Hermes is started by the virtual environment's own Python,
  by path, so every command the model runs sees the image's toolchain, not the venv's.
  (Hermes puts the directory its `hermes` command is found in first on each subshell's
  PATH; the image links `/usr/local/bin/hermes`, already on PATH, so that is a no-op.)
- While Hermes works, a line goes to stderr each time its session store changes: `-z`
  writes nothing else until it ends, and a quiet worker is otherwise indistinguishable
  from a stuck one.
